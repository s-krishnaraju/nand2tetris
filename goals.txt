************************ NAND TO TETRIS GOALS ************************
PURPOSE
 - Gain a deeper understanding of how computers actually work as well as the hardware/software abstractions that most software is built on 
 - Become a better programmer by working on a large project and learning about fundamental concepts like compilers, OS, programming languages, and computer architecture
 - Push myself by trying to learn and finish the contents of the book within a limted timeframe 

Try your very best to finish at least one chapter every day
if you have to stay up or get up earlier than do it, no excuses
